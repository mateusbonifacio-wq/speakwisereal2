# SpeakWise Real Frontend

React TypeScript frontend for the SpeakWise Real pitch coaching service.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file (optional, defaults to `http://localhost:8000`):
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory.
